# DFIR-IRIS Case Templates

This repository contains a collection of case templates designed for **DFIR-IRIS** to streamline and standardize security incident management.

----------

## What is DFIR-IRIS?

**DFIR-IRIS** (Incident Response and Intelligence System) is an open-source incident response platform that helps **DFIR** (Digital Forensics and Incident Response) teams track, manage, and collaborate during every phase of an incident.

----------

## Purpose

These templates provide a predefined structure for different incident types, enabling security analysts to:

-   **Accelerate case creation:** Eliminate the need to start from scratch for every incident.
-   **Standardize information gathering:** Ensure critical data is captured consistently.
-   **Improve collaboration:** Give teams a common framework to work from.
-   **Simplify post-incident analysis:** Rely on complete, structured information.

-   **Supply Chain Attack:** For incidents that affect the security of software or hardware supply chains.
-   **Generic Triage Analysis:** A general template for the initial triage phase of any unknown incident.
